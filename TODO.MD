# md pages

- md pages for javascript projects, maybe just one for all of these https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/2.%20JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/10.%20JavaScript%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures%20Projects.md#javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects
- have each md page pass some kind of default scale at a specific width for better scaling
  - maybe add zoom in / zoom out buttons
- ? add link/button to freecodecamp repo on each of the freecodecamp project pages, but that would be most, if not, all of them
- ? have buttons below iframe grayed out on page rather than gone. expand will always disappear on larger devices
- ? make buttons below iframe larger on larger screens

# not possible

- X replace iframe scrollbar (probably not possible) - not really possible

# Notes about project

- This was my first larger project working with React and Redux.
- I feel like most things here could have been done better.
- I would need to go through everything and basically redo the entire project to make things a lot cleaner at this point
- Overall I'm satisfied with what I've done
- Learned to use Gatsby along with GraphQL, at least in the way Gatsby makes use of it.
  - Learned a lot more about Typescript, this ties in with me needing to redo everything to make things cleaner.
    - My types and declaring functions and variables as types are not consistent throughout the project.
- Learned what works and doesn't work folder structure-wise. I feel I could have pulled off a lot more components to re-use

# md pages

- add navigational anchor links at bottom of project descriptions on iframe page (back to timeline/back to homepage)
- add note for each md page that styles might be off inside of the iframe
- have each md page pass some kind of default scale at a specific width for better scaling
  - maybe add zoom in / zoom out buttons
- ? add link to freecodecamp repo on each of the freecodecamp project pages, but that would be most, if not, all of them
- ? have buttons below iframe grayed out on page rather than gone. expand will always disappear on larger devices

# not possible

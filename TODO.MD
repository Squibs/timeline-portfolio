- scrollbar fade-in fade-out
- adjust margins media queries for content
- remove unnecessary gatsby plugins or other npm packages
- favicon
- accessibility elements/tags
- contact me form / section / page
- timeline page initially no navigation on right, appears when you select something on the timeline
- page transitions (left/right swipe) & min length of 0.5s for navigation css transitions to show
- replace iframe scrollbar (probably not possible)
- desktop mouseover iframe makes iframe larger/hide [onMouseEnter](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/blob/master/docs/parent_page/events.md#onmouseenter)
- have each md page pass some kind of default scale at a specific width for better scaling
  - maybe add zoom in / zoom out buttons
- ? add note for each md page that styles might be off inside of the iframe
- ? have buttons grayed out on page rather than gone. expand will always disappear on larger devices
- ? make buttons larger on larger screens

- ? click on square to select project for navigation
- ? click on squares on timeline to expand the project
- ? having everything hidden with just the gray squares and colored borders would immediately be seen as a way to interact with the site
  - not sure if having everything already expanded would read the same way when visiting the website.
  - could potentially add tutorial box saying click to select box, page nav, etc...
  - could add text inside of grey square with border saying click to select on each project on timeline

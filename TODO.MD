- adjust scroll to nearest project for mobile ~ 0.5-0.75 sec delay if in-between - on timeline
- auto navigate to selected project after an amount of time ~0.5 - 1 sec (could come with the following TODO)
- animate button when hovered/focused then selected
- smoothscroll for ios https://github.com/iamdustan/smoothscroll https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51731754/window-scroll-smooth-not-working-on-safari
- page transitions (left/right swipe) & min length of 0.5s for navigation css transitions to show
- scrollbar fade-in fade-out
- remove unnecessary gatsby plugins or other npm packages
- favicon
- add blobs to timeline, maybe sprinkle throughout
- accessibility elements/tags (image alt tags) - use firefox accessibility in console
- contact me form / section / page
- timeline page initially no navigation on right, appears when you select something on the timeline
- have each md page pass some kind of default scale at a specific width for better scaling
  - maybe add zoom in / zoom out buttons
- ? add note for each md page that styles might be off inside of the iframe
- ? have buttons grayed out on page rather than gone. expand will always disappear on larger devices
- ? make buttons larger on larger screens
- ? click on square to select project for navigation
- ? add ability to drag every element with mouse on other pages.

- X replace iframe scrollbar (probably not possible) - not really possible

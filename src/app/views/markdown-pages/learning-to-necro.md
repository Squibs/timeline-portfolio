### Project Information

One of my first web development projects. Around the release of <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Guild Wars 2</a>, I built this website as a way to learn more about html. While it may not have served a real purpose for players in the game, at the time or even today, I can look back at this being a first stepping stone into learning more about web development.

The site was originally hosted with it's own domain name: LearningToNecro.com, however there was no real point in keeping the domain name or paying to host the site. I have since re-hosted the site on Netlify.

Some of the features I put into the site are no longer operational:

- The RSS feed on the sidebar I've remade using a similar method to how I originally implemented it, this time using [RSS 2 HTML](https://rss.bloople.net/). Previously I had used RSSInclude.com, which no longer exists.

- The <b>Give Website Feedback</b> link in the sidebar also no longer works. This was done using PHP, and netlify does not support the use of PHP at runtime. I'm not worried about this not working as I have no plans to alter this site further.

- I originally had some Unity projects, mostly tutorials I had followed, hidden on the site that were playable via the Unity webplayer. You can find these Unity projects by going to the Resources tab, scrolling to the very bottom, and clicking on the very small pink dot beneath the Trading Post Calculator. The webplayer is no longer supported by most browsers, and only internet explorer really supports it anymore.

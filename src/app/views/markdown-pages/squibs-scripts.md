### Project Information

I decided it was time to create some node packages of my own. I wanted to have easy access to all my configuration files that I have been using.

The various configuration files I made are:

- Editor config
- ESLint config
- ESLint config for Typescript
- ESLint config for both Typescript and React
- Prettier config
- Typescript config

I made sure to include installation instructions for both `npm` and `yarn`. This was the first time I published my own packages to _npm_. I wanted to make sure if someone came across them and wanted to use them, they wouldn't have to search around for how to install them and get them working. I mostly use the _Airbnb_ _ESLint_ configuration, however I've made changes to it of my own.

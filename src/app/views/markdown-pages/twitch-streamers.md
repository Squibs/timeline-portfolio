### Project Information

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
TEMPORARY DELETE THIS AND REWRITE
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Note about how the Twitch API has changed since the creation of this project. I am now using a freeCodeCamp replacement pass-through for the API requests, which can be cached and show outdated information. Sometimes the pass-through also isn't quite working correctly and will show every channel as missing or not live.

I would have to revisit this project in the future to update to the new Twitch API and adjust all the JavaScript logic I am using in order to display the information I am already showing.

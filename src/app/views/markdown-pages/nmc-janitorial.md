### Project Information

I was fortunate enough to land a client, one that was willing to allow me to learn about the entire web development process of creating and deploying a website and everything that goes on in-between as well as after the site has been deployed.

I didn't want to do anything timorously, and spent my time making sure I was doing as many things as I could correctly. I created documentation I could share with the client, which noted most of everything I did for the website. This included time I spent creating the website, notes about search engine optimization, website speed, website security, mockups, dependencies, file structure, and anything else I could think of.

I wanted to get the most out of this opportunity and make them happy with their decision to allow me to rebuild their website. I used everything I learned going through freeCodeCamp so far and more to finish this website. There was so much I learned from this project, I wouldn't be able to list it all here. The big takeaway from this project was learning exactly what was needed to deploy a website. Things that worked in a local environment didn't work once deployed, and forms are a lot more complicated than they appear to be to the user.

Since the launch of their new website, I have come back and added additional features and changed things for them. Even though the project is complete, coming back and making these requested changes continues to be a learning experience, which I am very grateful for.

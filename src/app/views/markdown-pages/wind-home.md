description: 'The second freelance website I created for Wind Home Appliance Repair. For this project, I returned to a static website workflow. I did not have a previous website to reference for content this time around, as I built everything for this site from the ground up for a business that was just starting up. This project will forever be one of my most memorable ones.'

### Project Information

Formerly WindHomeAppliance.com / WindHomeApplianceRepair.com.

This project was my second project I did for a client. I was not comfortable yet with using React completely, so I decided to create this static website without it. This project was quite a bit different for me than my previous [client project](/project/nmc-janitorial), as this was for my brother-in-law Shane Windsheimer. The purpose of this project is to create a website from scratch for their newly established home appliance repair business. The main requested features are to create a modern/professional feeling website, that matches their logo, and to potentially gain more local customers through web traffic.

I started by creating several mockups of the website, these are some of them:

After a few mockup changes, I began creating the website. I used a lot of what I learned on the [NMC project](/project/nmc-janitorial) in order to finish this project. A lot of my time was spent on getting a unique design in place and making sure everything was fluid and was scaling properly for different screen sizes. I decided to include a _Learning Center_ section on the website to include more content for search engines to pick up on. This section goes over various simple frequently asked questions one might have when it comes to various appliances.

I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy this website. I figured since this was a static website, there was no need to use an expensive hosting service. _Netlify_ seemed like an easy choice to make after doing some research. The hosting is free, it provides some form handling, and has continuous deployment from _GitHub_.

This project will forever be one of my most memorable ones, as it will hold a special place in my heart. We unfortunately lost Shane in 2021, so this website serves as a my own memorial to him.

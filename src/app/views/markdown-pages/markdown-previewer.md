description: 'A fairly basic markdown previewer that I created using React. The use of Marked.js for markdown interpretation and Prism.js for syntax highlighting is what allows this project to exist. This project was more about using and learning more about React than it was anything else. I go back to this project as a reference whenever I need to re-remember anything about markdown.'

### Project Information

This project was one of the first projects I completed using React. This is a _front end development library_ project I completed while going through the lessons and challenges on freeCodeCamp.

The markdown here is being parsed and compiles into HTML by [Marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked#marked). The syntax highlighting for `<code>` blocks is handled by [Prism.js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism#prism). By default _Prism.js_ only loads `markup`, `css`, `clike`, and `javascript`. While there is an option to load more languages, I have decided to leave only these defaults, as I do not see myself using this project for much more than demonstration purposes.

This is the second project in which I have used my own [Webpack boilerplate](/project/react-redux-boilerplate), and so far I have not run across too many issues, if any at all. I feel quite happy that I took the time to learn Webpack before getting into these projects, as it has really helped me understand exactly what is going on when working with _Webpack_.

### Project Information

This project was one of the first projects I completed using React. This is a _front end development library_ project I completed while going through the lessons and challenges on freeCodeCamp.

The markdown here is being parsed and compiles into HTML by [Marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked#marked). The syntax highlighting for `<code>` blocks is handled by [Prism.js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism#prism). By default _Prism.js_ only loads `markup`, `css`, `clike`, and `javascript`. While there is an option to load more languages, I have decided to leave only these defaults, as I do not see myself using this project for much more than demonstration purposes.

This is the second project in which I have used my own [Webpack boilerplate](/project/react-redux-boilerplate), and so far I have not run across too many issues, if any at all. I feel quite happy that I took the time to learn Webpack before getting into these projects, as it has really helped me understand exactly what is going on when working with _Webpack_.

I have come back to this project more times than I thought I ever would. This is the fourth time I have come back to do this project. The first time, linked above ([before-react version](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/before-react)), was originally created as an _Intermediate Front End Development Project_ for freeCodeCamp. I later redid the project when I initially went through the _Front End Libraries Projects_ on the beta of freeCodeCamp ([old-react version](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/old-react)) as a project to learn React. I then came back, yet again, to re-create the project using React as well as Redux ([previous-react version](https://github.com/Squibs/quote-machine/tree/previous-react)).

This time around, on-top-of refreshing my memory of React and Redux, I wanted to learn Typescript. So I took it upon myself, while going through Stephen Grider's **Modern React with Redux** course on _Udemy_, to convert most of the lessons to Typescript ([view my certificate](https://github.com/Squibs/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/Images/certificates#udemy---modern-react-with-redux-by-stephen-grider---certification)). I came back to this project mostly because it was non-functional as the API had changed.

This version of this project makes use of React, Redux, Typescript, and Styled-Components. I have also adopted the [re-ducks](https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks) approach to folder structure... or at least my own version of it. I have a small hold on React-Redux at this point, and feel like I might actually be able to continue forward without having to return to this project again (unless the API changes again, or anything else that might warrant a re-visit).

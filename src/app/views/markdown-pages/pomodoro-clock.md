A pomodoro clock I created while going through the advanced front end development projects on freeCodeCamp. This project had the requirements of being able to start a 25 minute pomodoro that will go off once 25 minutes have elapsed, the ability to reset the clock, and the ability to customize the length of each pomodoro.

I decided to use object-oriented programming for this project. At first I was struggling to figure out exactly how to accomplish this. However after many tutorials and a lot of struggling, I came up with what this project is now. I have a Pomodoro class that has several methods to accomplish everything for this project. I'm still not quite sure I used the class identifier / object-oriented programming in a correct way.

I included the ability to adjust the focus time length, rest time length; as well as the ability to start, pause, resume and reset the time as it counts down. I decided to also include a volume slider to control the the volume of the alarms / alerts that go off once the timer reaches the end of the focus or rest time respectively.

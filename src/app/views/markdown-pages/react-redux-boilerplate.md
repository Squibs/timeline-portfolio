### Project Information

I created this boilerplate as a starting place for my own React-Redux projects. I learned that these NPM packages change quite quickly and keeping everything up to date is lot of work. I didn't end up using this boilerplate for a lot, but I did learn quite a lot more about Webpack in the creation of it.

I didn't structure this boilerplate to be as modular or as portable as it could have been. I struggled with figuring out a folder structure I was happy with. I decided after settling on the one I created for this boilerplate that I would rather use the [ducks / re-ducks](https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks#building-on-the-duck-legacy) folder structure.

I learned a lot about Webpack, working with node, express, and the importance of having both a development and production configuration for Webpack.

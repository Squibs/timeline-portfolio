### Project Information

While this was an early project in the freeCodeCamp curriculum, I wanted to created something that I would be proud of. I found a image that inspired the entire theme of this project and used it as a hero image for this portfolio.

I kept with the idea of building a website as mobile-first, so everything here reacts to screen size and adjusts accordingly. I wanted a more unique way to show off my projects I have worked on and decided on a card flipping mechanism to do so. I created a contact me form, which uses [formspree](https://formspree.io/) in order to skip having to use PHP or a backend to send me an email, which seemed like the easiest solution while using GitHub pages, which doesn't allow the use of a backend.

I later come back to update the projects with the ones I was most pleased with as I continued working through freeCodeCamp. This was the first project that felt like an actual website to me, so I spent a lot more time making sure I was very happy with what I was making. I've used this style throughout several more projects that you can see throughout my project timeline here.

### Project Information

This was the first _intermediate front end development_ project I completed while going through the challenges and lessons on freeCodeCamp. This project features a simple setup of an area for a title, content, and a footer; and below that features two buttons: one to generate a quote, and another to tweet the currently displayed quote. This project made use of the API of _Quotes on Design_ in order to retrieve the content for the quotes that are displayed.

Since this was another one page app or site, I wanted to make a unique look. I settled on having a cork board look with a pinned up notecard to display the fetched quotes with some tape or scrap paper to hold the buttons.

I've redone this project several times since this iteration. Which I talk about later in my timeline, which you can see [here](/project/quote-machine).

### Project Information

For this freeCodeCamp project I was tasked with created a technical documentation page. I decided to recreate the manual that came with my _AMD Ryzen CPU_. The navigation contains each heading in order to quickly get to any section.

freeCodeCamp provided several _user stories_, which included using tables, code, and other various HTML elements in order to create this project.

While this project was pretty simple, there was still things I was able to take away from completing it. Not all websites are about having fancy things to look at, and they can have a wide range of content. Displaying a document for users to go through might just be a case for making a website. Usability and getting information to people is very important and doing so in multiple ways isn't something to overlook.

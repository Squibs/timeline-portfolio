### Project Information

The third _intermediate front end development_ project I completed while going through the lessons and challenges on freeCodeCamp. For this project I created a simple site that uses the Wikipedia API to display search results from the user-entered information in the textbox.

As this project was fairly similar to the other _intermediate front end development_ projects, I decided to focus on learning more about CSS flexbox and grids. I use both of these in this project for my page layout.

I wanted to complete this project without the use of jQuery as well, in order to learn what jQuery has been doing for me in my previous projects. I have found out that it simply makes accomplishing simple tasks such as targeting HTML elements, changing CSS, or making AJAX calls simpler by reducing the amount of lines needed to accomplish the same task without jQuery.

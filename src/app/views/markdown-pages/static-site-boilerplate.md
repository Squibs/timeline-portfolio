description: 'During the creation of the NMC Janitorial Services project, it was clear to me I needed a way to bundle and deploy the code I was writing. I decided to make a boilerplate to do just that.'

### Project Information

At the time of creating this boilerplate, Webpack 4 was just barely released; and I had little knowledge of using any form of task runner (Gulp / Grunt), build tool / system, or module bundler. I managed to increase my knowledge of Webpack enough to create this boilerplate using the little amount of Webpack 4 documentation and tutorials available (mainly what was on the `next` branch on the webpack.js.org repository), and the previous documentation and tutorials for Webpack (Webpack 2 & 3); so hopefully I am learning and using Webpack 4 correctly.

I made this boilerplate alongside the [NMC Website](/project/nmc-janitorial) I created. I wanted a starting point for any future static website that I might create. I bundled all the NPM packages I was using at the time in this boilerplate for my own convenience.

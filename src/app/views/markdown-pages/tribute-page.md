### Project Information

The very first project I completed while going through the curriculum on freeCodeCamp. There are a number of _user stories_ that must be met which are various unit tests freeCodeCamp has built to help guide you through the project as well have you build a more proper structure rather than just blindly using various HTML elements.

I made a tribute page to John M. Keynes a 20th century British economist. This project at the time was the first project that did not guide the user step-by-step through the creation process. There is a test suite freeCodeCamp provided for these projects, although now they've built this into their in-browser code editor and everything is more interknit.

There really isn't anything that would stand out about this project. There's just the use of basic HTML elements, such as headings, un-ordered lists, an image, and an anchor link. I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 4.0.0 alpha classes at the time, as they had recently released that version.

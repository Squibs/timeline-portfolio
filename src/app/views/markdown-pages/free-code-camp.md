### Project Information

I decided to start using, and start learning, Git. I created a freeCodeCamp repository on (my Github)[https://github.com/Squibs/] to store notes, projects, lesson answers, and anything else relating to freeCodeCamp as I progress through their curriculum. I used to have two different repositories for freeCodeCamp, one for their beta lessons and challenges, and one for their main site. I merged these two into a new repository and have continued to update it.

I created a sort of navigation system within the repository for myself, and potentially others if they visit my repository. I created several links that match the freeCodeCamp curriculum that takes you to various markdown files of the notes and challenge solutions I came up with. Along-side my challenge solutions and notes, you can also find my various certificates, projects, and some references I created for myself.

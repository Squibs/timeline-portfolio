### Project Information

This is the third _advanced front end development_ project I completed while going through the lessons and challenges on freeCodeCamp. I was tasked with creating a _Simon Says_ game that has a number of features.

Those features being:

- The player is presented with a random series of button presses.
- Each time the player inputs a series of button presses correctly, they then see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
- There is a sound that corresponds to each button.
- If the wrong button is pressed the pattern is then re-shown to the player.
- The number of steps in the current round is visible.
- The game can be reset at anytime.
- There is a strict mode available to the player (no mistakes can be made).
- The player can win the game after getting a series of 20 steps correct.

When I first got to the _advanced front end projects_, I was slightly afraid to start this one as I was unsure of how to even begin creating such a thing. However after completing the [_JavaScript Calculator_](/project/js-calculator) project and the [_Pomodoro Clock_](/project/pomodoro-clock) project; I felt a lot more confident going into this project. Overall I learned quite a bit doing this project.

Overall I am quite happy with how this project came out, especially the design of it. I believe I could still improve this project quite a lot, especially as I learn more about JavaScript. I am slightly displeased with how things are on the mobile browsers; having to use a gimmicky method of getting sound to just work on iOS safari is something I'm not that happy about. In the end, this was a great project to go through in order to learn quite a lot.

### Project Information

The first _advanced front end development_ project I completed while going through the lessons and challenges on freeCodeCamp. For this project I was tasked with creating a calculator that can perform simple functions (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) on two numbers. The ability to clear all inputs, and the ability to chain mathematical operations together until the equal button is pressed. I decided to do just this, however, I expanded on it by just a bit.

I have put in the ability to delete previously entered values to allow for anything entered to be changed. I allowed for mathematical operations to be switched as soon as one is entered, which allows the user to skip having to hit backspace first. I made the calculator automatically enter in zeros at appropriate times, such as when typing in a decimal such as "0.5". I have also even decided to give the calculator a bit of scientific value and gave it an order of operation.

This project definitely can be expanded on, and in the future I might just decide to do so. Overall I am quite happy with what I have achieved while creating this project, and feel as though I have met the required freeCodeCamp _user stories_ and more.

### Project Information

After spending some time away from React and Redux, I wanted a refresher on working with them. I decided to take _Stephen Grider's Modern React Redux_ course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/). This course took me through about ten different projects of increasing complexity.

For me personally React and Redux was a barrier that took quite a bit of effort to get over. Sure I was creating React projects before, but I would continuously forget how to work with React due to small hiatuses or working on other projects. This course helped me figure out exactly what I was doing, and allowed me to eventually create this timeline portfolio that you are on now.

In this course I created:

- A simple blog post with comments.
- A site that changes based on geolocation.
- Image search using _Unsplash_
- _YouTube_ clone
- Custom routing with several different widgets on each route
- Song selector using _Redux_
- Another blog post type app with filler data from _JSONPlaceholder_
- _Twitch_ streams clone with _Google oAuth_
- Translation app using _React_ context system

Each of these are just some quick little sites / apps, but each one taught something different. Going through all of these got me ready to move back into doing my own _React_ _Redux_ projects.

### Project Information

A single site that is a collection of all the [D3](https://d3js.org/) projects I created that are required to get the freeCodeCamp _Data Visualization_ certification ([my certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/squibs/data-visualization)).

Each of these charts pulls in the data from various freeCodeCamp supplied GitHub endpoints / repositories via fetch requests. The data is then processed through the use of D3 to provide a visualization of the data.

I learned a lot about making use of D3js throughout these several projects. It was a bit of a struggle starting off, but as I moved onto each next project, it got easier and easier. There are loads of great examples out there for any type of chart/graph you want to make through the use of D3js. If you get stumped trying to display information in a format you wish, I'm sure there's an example you can closely follow.

In the future I think I would look to find better implementations of using D3js with React. A quick search led me to [React and D3](https://wattenberger.com/blog/react-and-d3). The adding of dom elements at the correct time and balancing which should be handled by react and which should be handled by D3 seemed to be slightly tricky to get down. I could definitely improve the implementation in which I ended up with.

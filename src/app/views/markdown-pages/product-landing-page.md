### Project Information

For this freeCodeCamp project I decided to create a product landing page for a pair of shoes. I looked through shoes until I found one that had colors that stood out to me; I then used the colors scheme of the shoes to build a page that would accent the product.

This was a project that was part of the _Responsive Web Design_ curriculum and had several _user stories_ I had to meet. These _user stories_ are just various unit test cases that freeCodeCamp sets to help guide you, in a way, while completing this project.

For this project I wanted to use some more HTML elements that I had not yet worked with, such as a video player and an image carousel. I also wanted to build out the project as a mobile-first site, so that as the screen gets larger the page layout adjusts accordingly using [flex-box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

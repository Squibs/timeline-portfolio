### Project Information

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I created while going through the _advanced front end development_ projects on freeCodeCamp. I was tasked with creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user can play a game against an AI opponent, be able to play again as soon as a game is over, and be able to choose whether they are playing as "X" or "O".

I was slightly surprised how quickly I was able to throw this project together. After messing with JavaScript classes for the past few projects, I feel a lot more comfortable working with them now. From the start of this project I knew exactly how I wanted things to be laid out, and how I was going to go about doing them. I decided to mess around with including an option type menu that would hide once the start game button was pressed; then the game board would appear.

If I were to improve something further on this project it would be to refactor the code I have written to condense it and make it cleaner. I could have implemented more computer difficulties. Could have used [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). Could have programmed in specific moves based on board state, as there are only so many combinations for tic-tac-toe. I settled on having a very simple ai, random number generator. While I completed this project quickly, I still learned a fair amount.
